Question answer for snippet 1:

I beleive that snippet 1 would only require a small change as it is just one link that is missing out. I think instead of an open bracket we would have to have a backtick1 and a backtick2 variable to see the positions of the backticks.

Question answer for snippet 2:

I beleive that the code change would be very small but also very confusing. I think that I must add an extra condition in the while loop that takes care of the index out of bounds exception.

Question answer for snippet 3:

Again there is an index out of bounds exception and I beleive that the fix would be very small. I think that I must add an extra condition in the while loop that takes care of the index out of bounds exception.
