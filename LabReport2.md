The error is that all of the links were not recognized.

## Part 4: Relationship between bug, symptom, and failure inducing input
The code is not designed for the second type of link formatting. Therefore it will not work for the following type input and it will only give one link as opposed to the two that are there.

## Part 4: Relationship between bug, symptom, and failure inducing input

The same error as before. The main method in the class is not yet adjusted to take the second method. The way in which I implemented the code was that I created a second method and it needed to be implemented in the main method.

## Part 4: Relationship between bug, symptom, and failure inducing input
The bug that I found was that I created two lists and I tried to add the elements from the second list into the first list but I made the mistake of just adding the elements from the second list to the second list instead of adding to the first list so I could get all of the links. The same symptom is there for all of the test cases.
