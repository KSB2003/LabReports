The error is that all of the links were not recognized.

## Part 4: Relationship between bug, symptom, and failure inducing input


The problem is that it would not recognize the 2nd type of link formatting in the breaking test file. It would only recognize the other type link. There would be a bug because we donâ€™t get all of the output that we expect. So I modified the code in order to be able to collect the second type of link. !

## Part 4: Relationship between bug, symptom, and failure inducing input

The same error as before. The main method in the class is not yet adjusted to take the second method. The way in which I implemented the code was that I created a second method and it needed to be implemented in the main method.

## Part 4: Relationship between bug, symptom, and failure inducing input
The bug that I found was that I created two lists and I tried to add the elements from the second list into the first list but I made the mistake of just adding the elements from the second list to the second list instead of adding to the first list so I could get all of the links. The same symptom is there for all of the test cases.
