## Lab Report 5

 - How you found the tests with different results (Did you use vimdiff on the
results of running a bash for loop? Did you search through manually? Did you
use some other programmatic idea?)

Answer: I searched through manually. 

## Test 1: 495

Describe which implementation is correct, or neither if both give the wrong output:
 - My group's implementation is wrong and the provided implementation is correct.

[link for test 495](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/495.md)

Output of provided implementation:
`[foo(and(bar))]`

Output of group/my implementation:
`[foo(and(bar]`

Expected output:
`[foo(and(bar))]`
